👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub.
I’m a motivated and curious IT student who loves blending clean code with meaningful design. Whether it’s a web app, a mobile interface, or a quick UI experiment, I enjoy creating experiences that feel smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.

💻 I’ve worked on various academic and university projects—building responsive layouts, crafting user-centered designs, and exploring new tools and technologies along the way.
⚡ I’m passionate about web development, emerging tech, and the hardware side of IT that keeps everything running.
🤝 I thrive in collaborative spaces where ideas flow, learning never stops, and every project becomes a chance to grow.

Thanks for dropping by—feel free to explore, fork, or just say hi! ✨
